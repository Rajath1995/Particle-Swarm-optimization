Particle Swarm Optimization For Various Fitness Function
Pseudo Code 

# Algorithm

The Algorithm Psuedo Code 

For each particle in swarm
	Initialize the particle position, fitness, best fitness, position in dictionary
End
While Iterations<100
	For each particle 
	     Calculate fitness value 
                 If the fitness value is better than best fitness value 
 	     Set the current values as the new best fitness value
           End
Choosing the particle with best value as the global best 
For each particle 
	Calculating the velocity from the above equation a
	Update the position of particle using eqn b
End
